## üöÄ Development Tasks & Features

### Current Issues - High Priority

- [x] **Scoring System Updates** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Updated scoring function and cleaned up existing scores
  - **Database Cleanup**: Successfully cleared all existing scores from both local and remote D1 databases due to scoring function changes
    - Removed all game sessions, reset user stats (games_played, total_score, average_score to 0)
    - Reset game play counts, ratings, and rating counts to 0 for clean slate
    - Deleted all existing game ratings for fair comparison after scoring changes
  - **Enhanced Score Storage**: Improved guess location storage for future score recalculation
    - Modified API client `submitScore()` to include detailed round data with user guess locations
    - Updated game store to pass complete round data (imageId, imageLocation, userGuess, score, distance) when submitting scores
    - Enhanced game sessions table to properly store guess locations in `rounds_data` JSON field for future score recalculation
    - System now captures all necessary data to recalculate scores if scoring algorithm changes again
  - **Account Creation Prompt**: Added post-game account creation flow for unsigned users
    - Created new `AccountCreationPrompt.svelte` component that appears after unsigned users complete custom games
    - Prompts users with their score and benefits of creating an account (save to leaderboard, track progress, create games, etc.)
    - Integrated with existing `AuthModal` component for seamless account creation workflow
    - Automatically saves completed game score to leaderboard after successful account creation
    - Added proper error handling for score submission failures with helpful user messaging
    - Enhanced user acquisition by converting anonymous players into registered users

### Current Issues - High Priority

- [x] **Sign Out Button Reliability Fix** - ‚úÖ FIXED: Sign out button often doesn't work until after a page refresh
  - **Root Cause**: Race condition in authentication state management where manual `clearAuth()` call in `signOut()` function was competing with the auth state listener's `clearAuth()` call when Supabase fired the `SIGNED_OUT` event
  - **Secondary Issue**: User menu dropdown would sometimes remain open even after sign out, creating inconsistent UI state
  - **Solution**: Improved authentication state synchronization and user interface handling
    - **Auth State Management**: Removed duplicate `clearAuth()` call from `signOut()` function to let the Supabase auth state listener handle all state clearing consistently
    - **Race Condition Prevention**: Added small delay in `signOut()` to ensure auth state change event fires properly before resolving
    - **Enhanced State Listener**: Improved `onAuthStateChange` listener to handle sign out events more robustly with immediate state clearing
    - **UI State Management**: Added reactive statement in Navigation component to automatically close user menu when user is no longer authenticated
    - **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Modified logout handler to close user menu immediately when clicked for better UX
    - **Fallback Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling with fallback auth clearing if something goes wrong
    - **Forced Re-render**: Enhanced `clearAuth()` function with setTimeout to force reactive component re-renders
  - **Results**: Sign out now works consistently on first click without requiring page refresh, user menu closes properly, and auth state synchronizes correctly across all components
  - Successfully deployed fix to ensure reliable sign out functionality

- [x] **Custom Game Images Not Loading** - ‚úÖ FIXED: Custom games work but images don't display properly
  - **Root Cause**: Image serving endpoint was using incorrect R2 object key - was using `imageId` directly instead of looking up the proper `r2Key` from database
  - **Solution**: Updated `/api/images/[imageId]/+server.ts` GET endpoint to:
    1. Query D1 database for image metadata using `imageId`
    2. Use the `r2Key` from metadata to fetch image from R2 storage
    3. Added proper error handling for missing images
  - Fixed image serving for all custom games by properly resolving R2 storage paths
  - Successfully deployed fix to https://d3840207.whereami-5kp.pages.dev
- [x] **Profile Editing Errors** - ‚úÖ COMPLETELY FIXED: Profile name/picture updates were causing errors and not displaying changes
  - **Backend Issue**: Frontend was sending `displayName` field but backend expected `username` field
    - **Solution**: Updated ProfileEdit component to send `username` instead of `displayName` in API calls
  - **Frontend Display Issue**: Backend returned `username`/`avatar` but frontend expected `displayName`/`profilePicture`
    - **Solution**: Updated `loadUserProfile()` in authStore.ts to properly map backend response fields:
      - `profile.username` ‚Üí `userProfile.displayName`
      - `profile.avatar` ‚Üí `userProfile.profilePicture`  
  - **Results**: Profile updates now save successfully AND display changes immediately
  - Successfully deployed complete fix to https://e782e98a.whereami-5kp.pages.dev
- [x] **Curated Images Empty Results & Landmark Upload D1 Fix** - ‚úÖ FIXED: The curated images endpoint returns empty results + landmark upload script not updating D1
  - **Root Cause**: The upload_landmark_images.py script was hitting the Cloudflare Functions endpoint which still used KV storage instead of D1
  - **Solution**: Updated Functions endpoint (`functions/api/images/upload-simple.js`) to use D1 database instead of KV
    - Added D1Utils classes for handling database operations in Cloudflare Functions
    - Migrated image metadata storage from KV to D1 `images` table
    - Updated user stats tracking to use D1 `users` table
    - Added support for custom names and source URLs (needed for landmark attribution)
    - Enhanced location handling to support both `lng` and `lon` field formats
  - **Benefits**: Landmark upload script now properly saves to D1 tables, enabling proper image discovery and gallery population
  - Successfully deployed D1-enabled Functions endpoint to https://d23c6727.whereami-5kp.pages.dev
  - Landmark uploads now create proper database records for curated image gallery

- [x] **Gallery Pagination Implementation** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Implemented proper server-side pagination for all galleries
  - **Previous Issue**: Gallery and create game pages showed only 50 photos max with client-side pagination
  - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive server-side pagination system
    - **Backend Changes**:
      - Added efficient `COUNT(*)` queries to D1Utils (`getUserImagesCount`, `getPublicImagesCount`, `getCuratedImagesCount`)
      - Updated all image API endpoints to use proper pagination instead of fetching large datasets
      - Removed artificial 50-photo limits throughout the system
    - **Frontend Changes**:
      - Updated `UserGallery` and `PublicGallery` components to use server-side pagination
      - Added `PaginatedImagesResponse` type for proper API response handling
      - Increased items per page from 12 to 24 for better user experience
      - Added pagination info (showing X-Y of Z photos) and smart page number display (max 10 pages visible)
      - Removed client-side filtering logic in favor of server-side processing
    - **User Experience**:
      - Galleries now load faster since only needed images are fetched
      - Pagination shows correct total counts and page numbers
      - Search/filter functionality prepared for future server-side implementation
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - All galleries now support unlimited photos with efficient pagination
  - Successfully deployed to production at https://c4c01f31.whereami-5kp.pages.dev

  - Added `getPublicImages()` method to API utility class for fetching curated public images
  - Created `PublicGallery.svelte` component with browsing functionality for curated photos
  - Updated gallery page to include three tabs: "My Photos", "Curated", and "Upload"
  - Curated gallery shows images from a special "public" user account, separate from user-contributed photos
  - Only images uploaded by the dedicated public user (userId: 'public') appear in this gallery
  - Enhanced gallery navigation with proper tab switching and URL parameter handling
  - Successfully deployed corrected implementation to production at https://600a4b83.whereami-5kp.pages.dev

  - Supports attribution for both curated public images and user-uploaded images with sources
  - Successfully deployed to production at https://f29b4ccf.whereami-5kp.pages.dev
- [x] **Antimeridian Crossing Pin Placement Fix** - Fixed issue where pins were placed on wrong world copy when zoomed out
  - **Root Cause**: While Leaflet's `worldCopyJump` handles most antimeridian cases, pins could still be placed an entire map apart when zoomed out, even though distance calculation was correct
  - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive antimeridian crossing handling in game logic and map components
    - Added `normalizeLongitude()` function to ensure all coordinates are in [-180, 180] range
    - Created `calculateLongitudeDifference()` to find shortest longitude difference considering antimeridian crossing
    - Implemented `findOptimalActualLocation()` to determine which world copy of the actual location minimizes distance to the guess
    - Enhanced `calculateDistance()` function to use normalized coordinates and optimal longitude differences
    - Updated `processGuess()` to use optimal actual location for accurate distance calculation and pin placement
    - Modified Map component to normalize marker positions using `normalizeMarkersForDisplay()` function
    - Enhanced `calculateGeodesicPath()` to use normalized coordinates for proper distance line rendering
  - **Technical Implementation**:
    - All longitude values are normalized to [-180, 180] range before calculations
    - Distance calculation considers both possible actual locations (east and west of antimeridian) and chooses the shortest
    - Map markers are placed using optimal coordinates to ensure they appear on the correct world copy
    - Distance lines properly follow the shortest great-circle path across the antimeridian
    - Click handlers normalize longitude coordinates to prevent edge case issues
  - **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite to verify antimeridian crossing scenarios (Tokyo to Honolulu, etc.)
  - Successfully deployed to production at https://883157ef.whereami-5kp.pages.dev
  - **UX Enhancement**: Fixed pin placement visibility issue where clicks near antimeridian appeared to not register
    - **Problem**: While distance calculations were correct, pins would "jump" to opposite side of map when clicked near ¬±180¬∞ longitude
    - **Solution**: Separated "display location" from "calculation location" - pins now appear where user clicked, but optimal locations are still used for distance calculations
    - **Result**: Improved user experience where guess pins stay visible near click location while maintaining accurate shortest-distance scoring
    - Successfully deployed UX fix to production at https://8eda275b.whereami-5kp.pages.dev
  - **Results Display Optimization**: Enhanced pin positioning during results phase for optimal distance visualization
    - **Behavior**: During guessing phase, pins appear exactly where user clicks (good UX). During results display, both pins move to optimal normalized positions for clearest shortest-distance visualization
    - **Implementation**: Uses `showDistanceLine` flag to determine phase - preserves click location during guessing, optimizes positioning for results
    - **Benefits**: Best of both worlds - responsive clicking experience during gameplay, optimal visual representation during results
    - Successfully deployed results optimization to production at https://0dcb7b5b.whereami-5kp.pages.dev

    - Random image endpoint (`/api/images/random`) correctly filters to only public images via `getPublicImages()` query
    - Public gallery endpoint properly excludes private images using `WHERE is_public = true` database filter
    - Private images only accessible by the owner and only appear in games they create
  - **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with clear privacy implications
    - Default setting is public to maintain existing behavior for new users
    - Visual feedback shows privacy state with emoji indicators (üåç for public, üîí for private)
    - Individual photo privacy can be changed after upload before submission
    - Global setting affects all new uploads but individual settings can override

# WhereAmI Development Guide

## Development vs Production Deployments

### üîß Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Test features without affecting production
- **URL**: `https://dev.whereami.pages.dev`
- **Data**: Uses the same KV namespaces and R2 bucket as production
- **Project**: `whereami` on Cloudflare Pages (dev branch)

### üöÄ Production Environment  
- **Purpose**: Live site for users
- **URL**: `https://geo.cmxu.io`
- **Data**: Shared with development (same backend)
- **Project**: `whereami` on Cloudflare Pages (main branch)

## Deployment Commands

### Quick Commands (npm scripts):
```bash
# Deploy to development
npm run deploy:dev

# Deploy to production  
npm run deploy:prod
```

### Manual Commands:
```bash
# Deploy to development
./deploy.sh development

# Deploy to production
./deploy.sh production

# Default (production)
./deploy.sh
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Make changes locally**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Test locally first
   ```

2. **Deploy to development for testing**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:dev
   ```
   - Test at `https://dev.whereami.pages.dev`
   - Same data as production, separate frontend
   - Safe to test features, break things, etc.

3. **Deploy to production when ready**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```
   - Updates `https://geo.cmxu.io`
   - Only do this when features are tested and ready

## Environment Variables

Both environments use the same:
- KV namespaces (IMAGE_DATA, USER_DATA, GAME_DATA)
- R2 bucket (whereami-images) 
- Backend endpoints and data

This means:
- ‚úÖ You can test with real data
- ‚úÖ No need to duplicate data
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Be careful**: Changes to data affect both environments

## Maintenance Mode

To enable maintenance mode on either environment:
1. Edit `src/routes/+layout.svelte`
2. Change `const MAINTENANCE_MODE = false;` to `const MAINTENANCE_MODE = true;`
3. Deploy to the desired environment:
   - Dev only: `npm run deploy:dev`
   - Production only: `npm run deploy:prod`
   - Both: Deploy to both environments
