# WhereAmI - Development Roadmap

## 🌍 Project Overview

**WhereAmI** is a modern geography guessing game built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Players are shown photos from around the world and must guess the location by clicking on an interactive map. The game features distance-based scoring, custom game creation, social sharing, and a community-driven discovery system.

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers + R2 Storage + KV Database
- Maps: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages

---

## 🚀 Development Tasks & Features

- [ ] When in game, if you click the whereami logo that should exit the current game
- [ ] Logging out and back in resets the user's display name and profile picture
- [ ] Uploading pictures still is a bit buggy. For example, when I upload 4 pictures, only 3 actually get uploaded
- [ ] If the user only updates their name then it should not update the profile picture
- [ ] If the user is already on the Gallery page and logs in, the gallery page says not authenticated until after some user action
- [ ] Clicking on the map/placing a pin zooms out, clicking and placing a pin should not affect the zoom
- [ ] Refreshing the page makes the game think it's logged out even though you are not
- [ ] Optimize image loading and compression
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for API failures
- [ ] Adjust profile picture, zoom and move

## Completed Tasks
