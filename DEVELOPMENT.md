# WhereAmI - Development Roadmap

## üåç Project Overview

**WhereAmI** is a modern geography guessing game built with SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Players are shown photos from around the world and must guess the location by clicking on an interactive map. The game features distance-based scoring, custom game creation, social sharing, and a community-driven discovery system.

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers + R2 Storage + KV Database
- Maps: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages

## üöÄ Development Tasks & Features

- [x] Fix TypeScript accessibility warnings in components
- [ ] Optimize image loading and compression
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for API failures
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed network requests
- [ ] Create user profile customization (username/profile photo/etc)
- [ ] Create dark mode theme
- [ ] The search bar is 2 px taller than the rest of the buttons on its row (in the gallery tab)
- [ ] Upload more button does not actually switch tabs
- [ ] Delete Image Functionality: modify R2 and KV for user/game data
- [ ] When selecting photos for a new game, you should be able to click anywhere on the picture to select/deselect it
- [ ] Allow user to modify the name of their image when uploading and in the gallery
- [ ] Generate random game is not working
- [ ] Create custom game tab needs an 'x' to close it out and a create game button
- [ ] Allow user to edit their display name/username (this is distinct from their actual name)
- [ ] Allow user to add a profile picture
- [ ] If the user is already on the Gallery page and logs in, the gallery page is not able to load their pictures until after a refresh
- [ ] On profile page don't need the profile button of the extra username box between the profile button and the back to home button
- [ ] The user should be able to select multiple images to upload at a time, currently if you select multiple images it only takes the first image
- [x] Change organization: Top level tabs should be Play/Gallery/Browse/Create. The play/default welcome screen should allow the user to start a random game or go to browse user created games. Gallery shows your current photos and gives you the ability to upload/delete/modify your photos (make sure to integrate the upload screen with the gallery). Browse should show a list of public games/your personal games. Create should allow you to create new games with your existing images (it should also have a button to redirect to gallery to upload new images)
- [x] Fix multiple file selection in upload functionality - users can now select multiple images at once
- [x] Remove separate upload page and integrate all upload functionality into Gallery upload tab
- [x] Update all "Upload More" buttons to redirect to Gallery upload tab instead of separate upload page
- [x] Move upload tutorial from separate upload page to Gallery upload tab
- [x] Fix "Upload More" button behavior to act exactly like clicking the upload tab button
