The game features distance-based scoring, custom game creation, social sharing, and a community-driven discovery system.

**Tech Stack:**

- Frontend: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Cloudflare Workers + R2 Storage + KV Database
- Maps: Leaflet with OpenStreetMap
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages

## 🚀 Development Tasks & Features
- [ ] If the user is already on the Gallery page and logs in, the gallery page says not authenticated until after some user action
- [ ] Implement the search function on the browse games screen
- [ ] Show the default state for the dropdown menus on the browse games screen (i.e. Most Played and All Difficulties)
- [ ] Optimize image loading and compression
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries for API failures
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed network requests
- [ ] The user should be able to select multiple images to upload at a time, currently if you select multiple images it only takes the first image


## Completed Tasks
- [x] **Remove Game Deletion Success Popup**: Successfully removed the "Game deleted successfully!" popup that appeared after deleting a game:
  - 🚫 **Removed Alert**: Eliminated the success alert that showed after game deletion in the Browse page
  - ✨ **Better UX**: Users can now see the game disappear from the list immediately without an intrusive popup
  - 🎯 **Visual Feedback**: The immediate removal of the game card provides clear visual confirmation that the deletion was successful
  - 🔄 **Error Handling**: Kept error alerts for failed deletions to ensure users are informed of any issues
- [x] **Game Deletion Authentication Fix**: Successfully resolved the "please sign in to delete games" error that occurred even when users were already authenticated:
  - 🔧 **Root Cause**: The game deletion endpoint was using a different authentication method (Supabase API call) compared to other endpoints (local JWT parsing)
  - ✨ **Solution**: Updated `/api/games/[gameId]` DELETE endpoint to use the same JWT token parsing method as all other endpoints
  - 🔐 **Consistency**: All endpoints now use the same authentication verification approach for reliability
  - 🧪 **Testing**: Verified the fix works correctly with Playwright tests showing proper authentication handling
  - ✅ **Result**: Users can now successfully delete their games without false authentication errors
- [x] **Public Games Display Fix**: Successfully resolved the issue where public games were not being shown on the Browse page:

- [x] The toggle should just be dark/light mode it can be a button or toggle that switches between them, the default behaviour should be system if the user has never modified the toggle
- [x] Upload more button does not actually switch tabs
- [x] Change organization: Top level tabs should be Play/Gallery/Browse/Create. The play/default welcome screen should allow the user to start a random game or go to browse user created games. Gallery shows your current photos and gives you the ability to upload/delete/modify your photos (make sure to integrate the upload screen with the gallery). Browse should show a list of public games/your personal games. Create should allow you to create new games with your existing images (it should also have a button to redirect to gallery to upload new images)
