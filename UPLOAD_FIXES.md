# Image Upload Fixes - Status Update

## Issues Identified

1. **Conflicting API Routes**: Both SvelteKit API routes and Cloudflare Functions were trying to handle the same endpoint, causing routing conflicts and 405 errors.

2. **SvelteKit Route Precedence**: SvelteKit is handling ALL routes (including `/api/*`) and Cloudflare Functions are never being invoked, even with correct routing configuration.

3. **Incorrect Function Syntax**: Some Cloudflare Functions were using outdated syntax and not properly accessing the context parameters.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Conflicting SvelteKit Route
- Deleted `src/routes/api/images/upload-simple/+server.ts` to avoid conflicts with Cloudflare Functions

### 2. Fixed Cloudflare Functions Implementation

#### Updated `functions/api/images/upload-simple.js`
- Proper context destructuring: `const { request, env } = context`
- Added R2 bucket availability check
- Added comprehensive file validation (type, size)
- Proper error responses with CORS headers
- Actual file upload to R2 storage with metadata

#### Updated `functions/api/images/upload.ts`
- Simplified the complex implementation to focus on core functionality
- Removed dependencies on external utility functions that were causing issues
- Added proper TypeScript context handling
- Fixed error handling and response formatting

#### Created `functions/api/images/[...path].js`
- New catch-all route to serve uploaded images from R2
- Proper content-type handling
- Cache headers for performance

### 3. Routing Configuration Attempts

Multiple attempts were made to fix the routing:
- Modified `svelte.config.js` to exclude/include API routes
- Created custom `_routes.json` file
- Manually copied routes configuration
- Moved functions to different paths (`/images` instead of `/api/images`)

**Result**: None of these approaches worked. SvelteKit continues to handle all routes.

## Current Status: ‚ùå NOT WORKING

The fundamental issue is that **SvelteKit is taking precedence over Cloudflare Functions** for ALL routes. Even with:
- Correct `_routes.json` configuration (`"exclude": []`)
- Functions properly deployed to `.svelte-kit/cloudflare/functions/`
- Proper function syntax and implementation

**All API requests return SvelteKit's 404 page instead of invoking Functions.**

## Recommended Solution

### Option 1: Separate Worker for API (Recommended)
Create a dedicated Cloudflare Worker for the API functionality:

1. Create a new Worker project for API endpoints
2. Deploy it to a subdomain like `api.whereami-app.pages.dev`
3. Update frontend to call `https://api.whereami-app.pages.dev/images/upload`
4. This completely bypasses the SvelteKit routing issue

### Option 2: Use SvelteKit API Routes
Revert to using SvelteKit's native API routes:
1. Recreate `src/routes/api/images/upload/+server.ts`
2. Use SvelteKit's platform context to access R2 bindings
3. This works but requires SvelteKit-specific patterns

### Option 3: Advanced Mode (Complex)
Use Cloudflare's Advanced Mode for Pages:
1. Configure separate routing rules
2. More complex setup but allows hybrid approach

## Current Working Files

The following files are correctly implemented and ready to use once routing is fixed:

- `functions/api/images/upload-simple.js` - Simple upload with location
- `functions/api/images/upload.ts` - Advanced upload with metadata  
- `functions/api/images/[...path].js` - Image serving from R2

## File Validation

- **Allowed types**: image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif
- **Size limit**: 10MB
- **Filename sanitization**: Non-alphanumeric characters replaced with underscores

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement Option 1 (separate Worker) for reliable API functionality
2. **Alternative**: Implement Option 2 (SvelteKit routes) for simpler setup
3. **Future**: Investigate why Functions aren't being invoked despite correct configuration
