# WhereAmI Game Images

This directory is where you can add your own images with GPS metadata to use in the WhereAmI game.

## How to Add Images

1. Place JPG or PNG images with GPS EXIF metadata in this directory
2. The game will automatically extract the location data from the images
3. For each game, 3 random images will be selected from this directory

## Tips for Good Images

- Use images with clear GPS data in their EXIF metadata
- Choose interesting and varied locations around the world
- Try to include some visual clues that could help players identify the location
- Use high-quality images that load quickly (ideally optimized for web)

## Example Usage

You can add images from your travels, interesting places you've visited, or use publicly available geotagged images (respecting copyright, of course).

## Note About Sample Images

The sample images included by default (sample1.jpg through sample5.jpg) are placeholders that simulate real images with location data. In a real game setup, you would replace these with actual JPG or PNG files that contain GPS EXIF metadata.

## Finding Images with EXIF Data

Most smartphone photos automatically include GPS coordinates in their EXIF data if location services were enabled when the photo was taken. You can also use various tools to manually add location data to images.
