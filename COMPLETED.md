## üèÜ Completed Features & Fixes

- [x] **Continue Game Popup Fix - RESOLVED**: Successfully fixed the critical issue where the continue game popup wouldn't appear on the home screen after leaving a game until the page was refreshed:
  - üîß **Root Cause**: The `hasSavedGameInProgress` store wasn't being refreshed when returning to the home page after leaving a game
  - ‚ú® **Home Page Fix**: Added `checkForSavedGame()` call in home page `onMount` to refresh saved game status when the page loads
  - üíæ **Exit Button Fix**: Modified `handleBackToHome()` in play page to explicitly call `saveGame()` before navigating to ensure game state is saved
  - üéØ **Logo Navigation**: The logo click already worked correctly due to existing `saveGame()` call in navigation component
  - üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: Created extensive Playwright test suite covering all navigation methods (logo click, exit button, resume functionality)
  - ‚úÖ **All Tests Pass**: Verified that continue game popup appears correctly for both logo navigation and exit button usage
  - üîÑ **State Management**: Both navigation methods now properly save game state and trigger the continue popup on return

## Completed Tasks


- [x] ~~When the map is big, it covers the submit button area, make sure the z levels are set correctly~~ **FIXED**: Reduced action buttons z-index to z-60 and added viewport constraints (max-width: calc(100vw - 48px)) to ensure buttons stay within screen bounds. Action buttons positioned at bottom-right with proper spacing.
- [x] ~~When the map is small, after submitting a guess, the next round button and other stats get cutoff, make sure they are correctly placed~~ **FIXED**: Reverted to original small map layout structure. Stats (score, badge, distance) appear in the action-buttons area after location submission, maintaining the original styling but ensuring proper visibility order. Reset button SVG also fixed with cleaner refresh icon.
- [x] ~~For the small map, the text and distance still appear behind the map, make them appear after the round but they should be in the same div as the next round button and the map (in between them)~~ **FIXED**: Restructured small map overlay to place result stats in a separate `result-stats` section positioned between the map container and action buttons. Added proper z-index (z-50) and background styling to ensure stats are visible above the map (z-10). Test confirmed correct layout order: Map -> Result Stats -> Button.
- [x] ~~Small map result stats should push the map up instead of overlaying, and remove white background~~ **IMPROVED**: Modified the small map layout so result stats appear inline in the flex container, pushing the map up by reducing its height (from 80px to 160px spacing when stats appear). Removed white background styling so stats blend naturally with the overlay. Test confirmed: stats push map up with correct layout order and no white background.
- [x] ~~Container should grow to accommodate stats instead of shrinking map~~ **FINAL**: Updated the small map layout so the map maintains its original size (320px) while the outer container grows (to 492px) to accommodate the result stats. Stats appear inline without white background, creating a natural flow: Map (original size) ‚Üí Stats (transparent) ‚Üí Action Buttons. Test confirmed: container grows, map stays same size, no white background.
- [x] ~~Improve stats display organization and use consistent transparent backgrounds~~ **ENHANCED**: Redesigned result stats layout from vertical stacking to an elegant horizontal organization: Score (left) ‚Üî Distance (right) with Badge centered below. Applied consistent transparent/blur background styling (`bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-md`) to big map result panel, matching other overlays. Added proper text shadows for better contrast. Test confirmed: horizontal layout working, both layouts use transparent backgrounds.
- [x] ~~Position badge/message between score and distance in horizontal layout~~ **FINAL**: Updated both small map and big map result panels to use a three-column horizontal layout: Score (left) ‚Üî Badge (center) ‚Üî Distance (right). Badge now appears inline between the score and distance rather than below them. Updated CSS with flexible layout (`score-section`/`distance-section` at 35% max-width each, `badge-section` auto-width) and reduced gap for better spacing. Both layouts now consistently show the message/rating badge positioned between the numerical values.
- [x] ~~Make points inline with score number, remove "away" text, standardize styling~~ **ENHANCED**: Updated both small map and big map result layouts to display "points" inline with the score number (e.g., "4,500 points" instead of score on one line and "points" below). Removed the word "away" from distance display, showing just the formatted distance (e.g., "125 km"). Standardized font styling to use `font-medium` for both points and distance text, with consistent color schemes: small map uses `text-gray-600`, big map uses `text-gray-300` for better contrast on transparent backgrounds. Layout is now more compact and visually consistent across both display modes.
- [x] ~~Standardize font sizes and styling for consistent visual hierarchy~~ **COMPLETE**: Fully standardized font styling across both big map and small map layouts. All score values, points text, distance values, and distance text now use consistent `text-lg font-medium` styling. Big map: score and points use `text-lg`, distance uses `text-lg` with `text-gray-300` color. Small map: score and points use `text-lg`, distance uses `text-lg` with `text-gray-600` color. The word "points" is now inline with the score number in both layouts. All text elements maintain the same visual hierarchy and proportional relationships, creating a unified and consistent user experience across both display modes. Badge sizes remain differentiated (`text-sm` for big map, `text-xs` for small map) to maintain proper visual balance.
- [x] Fixed SVG icons being cut off - corrected reset icon paths to fit within 24x24 viewBox
- [x] Updated resize handles to use three filled dots positioned as corner grips with no background - made circles bigger (radius 2), more spread out, and positioned farther from corners
- [x] Fixed z-index issue where large map covered submit buttons - increased action buttons z-index to z-[100], set map container to z-0, and added pointer-events management
- [x] Fixed positioning issue where small map result panels get cut off - added max-height constraints, scrollable action buttons area, proper viewport bounds checking, and restructured result layout to show score/distance above button
- [x] **Updated distance formatting structure** - Modified `formatDistance` function to return separate numeric value and unit string instead of combined string. Updated all related types (`GuessResult`, `Round`, `CompletedRound`) to have `formattedDistance: number` and `formattedDistanceUnit: string` properties. Propagated changes throughout the codebase including GameRound.svelte, GameResults.svelte, gameStore.ts, and server-side save functions. Distance display now properly concatenates the number and unit (e.g., "125km", "500m") in all UI components.

- [x] Move the expand map button to the top left, make it less opaque, give it an expand ("‚Üò" - contract, "‚Üñ" - expand).
- [x] Fix the UI on the expanded map, make it fit the screen, show the image in a smaller box on the bottom left, make sure the map rerenders
- [x] Add ability to drag the top left hand corner of the small map to adjust it's size
- [x] Move the +/- on the map to the bottom right
- [x] Add a fit to width toggle for the images during the game
- [x] When the image is all the way zoomed out, first click should zoom in one step
- [x] Add ability to zoom on photos in round review
- [x] Game progress bar should start at 0 not 1 as the current round has not yet been completed
- [x] Pins on the map locations should be based on the tip not the center of the circle, so placing and measuring distance should be based on the tip
- [x] Give the game info bar a small amount of padding at the top
- [x] The game review screen should allow you to review the picture and the map with your guess/actual location when the round is clicked on, it can be a popup should the image and map side by side

- [x] **View Final Results Button Fix**: Successfully resolved the issue where the "View Final Results" button was not working on the final round:
  - üîß **Root Cause**: The `handleNextRound` function in GameRound component was dispatching a `gameComplete` event instead of calling `proceedToNextRound()` when it was the last round
  - ‚ú® **Solution**: Simplified the logic to always call `proceedToNextRound()` which properly handles both advancing to next rounds AND completing the game when appropriate
  - üéØ **Game Flow Fix**: The `proceedToNextRound()` function already correctly sets `gameComplete: true` in the game state when `nextRound >= rounds.length`

- [x] When moving onto the next round, the map loads forever
- [x] **Map Loading Fix for Next Round Transitions**: Successfully resolved the issue where the map would load forever when transitioning to the next round in the game:
  - üîß **Root Cause**: The reactive statement in GameRound component was resetting `mapReady = false` when transitioning to the next round, causing the map to show loading state indefinitely
  - ‚ú® **Solution**: Removed the unnecessary `mapReady = false` reset from the reactive statement since the map doesn't need to be reinitialized between rounds
  - üéØ **State Management**: Cleaned up redundant state resets in `handleNextRound()` function to avoid duplication with reactive statement
  - üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: Created dedicated Playwright test to verify map transitions work correctly without infinite loading
  - ‚úÖ **Verified Fix**: Test results show `Map loading indicator visible: false`, `Map is interactive: true`, `Submit button visible in round 2: true`
  - üöÄ **Successfully Deployed**: Game now properly transitions between rounds with map remaining interactive and ready for the next guess
- [x] **Map Click Handler Fix for Next Round Transitions**: Successfully resolved the issue where the map would not respond to clicks when transitioning to the next round in the game:
  - üîß **Root Cause**: The click handler in the Map component was only added once during `onMount` if `clickable` was initially true, but there was no reactive handling when the `clickable` prop changed from `false` (during results) back to `true` (for the next round)
  - ‚ú® **Solution**: Added a reactive statement to properly manage click handler attachment/removal when the `clickable` prop changes, and refactored to use a stored click handler reference for proper cleanup
  - üéØ **State Management**: The map now properly adds/removes click handlers reactively based on the `clickable` prop, making it interactive for new rounds
  - üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: Created dedicated Playwright test to verify map click functionality works correctly through round transitions
