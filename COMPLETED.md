- [x] **View Final Results Button Fix**: Successfully resolved the issue where the "View Final Results" button was not working on the final round:
  - 🔧 **Root Cause**: The `handleNextRound` function in GameRound component was dispatching a `gameComplete` event instead of calling `proceedToNextRound()` when it was the last round
  - ✨ **Solution**: Simplified the logic to always call `proceedToNextRound()` which properly handles both advancing to next rounds AND completing the game when appropriate
  - 🎯 **Game Flow Fix**: The `proceedToNextRound()` function already correctly sets `gameComplete: true` in the game state when `nextRound >= rounds.length`
  - 🔄 **State Management**: Game completion now properly triggers the transition from GameRound to GameResults component via the game state
  - ✅ **Verified Fix**: The game now correctly shows the final results screen when clicking "🏆 View Results" after the last round

  - ⚠️ **Note**: There may still be edge case bugs with distance calculation in certain longitude crossing scenarios that need further investigation
- [x] Refreshing the page makes the game think it's logged out even though you are not
- [x] If the user only updates their name then it should not update the profile picture
- [x] Logging out and back in resets the user's display name and profile picture
- [x] When moving onto the next round, the map loads forever
- [x] **Map Loading Fix for Next Round Transitions**: Successfully resolved the issue where the map would load forever when transitioning to the next round in the game:
  - 🔧 **Root Cause**: The reactive statement in GameRound component was resetting `mapReady = false` when transitioning to the next round, causing the map to show loading state indefinitely
  - ✨ **Solution**: Removed the unnecessary `mapReady = false` reset from the reactive statement since the map doesn't need to be reinitialized between rounds
  - 🎯 **State Management**: Cleaned up redundant state resets in `handleNextRound()` function to avoid duplication with reactive statement
  - 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**: Created dedicated Playwright test to verify map transitions work correctly without infinite loading
  - ✅ **Verified Fix**: Test results show `Map loading indicator visible: false`, `Map is interactive: true`, `Submit button visible in round 2: true`
  - 🚀 **Successfully Deployed**: Game now properly transitions between rounds with map remaining interactive and ready for the next guess
- [x] **Map Click Handler Fix for Next Round Transitions**: Successfully resolved the issue where the map would not respond to clicks when transitioning to the next round in the game:
  - 🔧 **Root Cause**: The click handler in the Map component was only added once during `onMount` if `clickable` was initially true, but there was no reactive handling when the `clickable` prop changed from `false` (during results) back to `true` (for the next round)
  - ✨ **Solution**: Added a reactive statement to properly manage click handler attachment/removal when the `clickable` prop changes, and refactored to use a stored click handler reference for proper cleanup
  - 🎯 **State Management**: The map now properly adds/removes click handlers reactively based on the `clickable` prop, making it interactive for new rounds
  - 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**: Created dedicated Playwright test to verify map click functionality works correctly through round transitions
  - ✅ **Verified Fix**: Test results show map remains interactive and responsive to clicks in subsequent rounds
  - 🚀 **Successfully Deployed**: Game now provides seamless interaction when progressing through multiple rounds
